This GitHub repossitory will provide template custom XML files which can be used with Citrix Xenmobile and Citrix Endpoint Management.
The custome xml files are intended to be used for modern management of Windows 10 Endpoint in the case that Citrix doesnt provide a GUI driven policy for the needed configuration.
The custom XML templates are based up-on the open Windows 10 modern management standard Configuration Service Provider (CSP)
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/configuration-service-provider-reference

A configuration service provider (CSP) is an interface to read, set, modify, or delete configuration settings on the device. These settings map to registry keys or files. Some configuration service providers support the WAP format, some support SyncML, and some support both. SyncML is only used over–the–air for Open Mobile Alliance Device Management (OMA DM).

Please contribute in adding more XML templates for Citrix Endpoint Management.

With kind regards,
Jeroen J.V Lebon
