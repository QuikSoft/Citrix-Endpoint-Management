Added in Windows 10, version 1709. Boolean policy to disable the visibility of the credential provider that triggers the PC refresh on a device.

The admin user is required to authenticate to trigger the refresh on the target device.
The Windows 10 Automatic ReDeployment feature allows admin to reset devices to a known good managed state while preserving the management enrollment. 
After the automatic redeployment is triggered the devices are for ready for use by information workers or students.
The following list shows the supported values:
0 - Enable the visibility of the credentials for Windows 10 Automatic ReDeployment
1 - Disable visibility of the credentials for Windows 10 Automatic ReDeployment
